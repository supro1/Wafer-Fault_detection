# Wafer_Fault_detection

Texas Instruments is one of the most prominent semiconductor and sensor manufacturers in the world building world class sensors. We built cloud-based solution to detect wafer anomaly in semiconductor manufacturing. The application leverages custom ML models to automatically detect and classify anomalies by analyzing the outputs of individual sensors in a stack.

Below is the functional diagram of automated data gathering, validation, data preprocessing, model creation and prediction pipeline.
